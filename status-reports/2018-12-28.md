Release 1.13 (Updated dependencies)

Scope Status
* Add servlet support [60%]
* Update project dependencies [100%]
* Description for Takes based REST services [none]
* Replace Guava with Cactoos [15%]
* Null removal [20%]


Issues:
* Takes does not comply fully to EO standards anymore
* Project needs funding. Did not proposed members to work for free because 
0crat does not assign tasks in projects in debt, but this issue will be fixed
 soon

Risks
* Cactoos may not provide all features to fully replace Guava [1/7]
* Some project members may not agree in working for free until funds are added
 to project. This can cause our team to shrink and make delivery pace to slow again [4/7]
