Scope Status
* Add servlet support [70%]
* Description for Takes based REST services [none]
* Replace Guava with Cactoos [15%]
* Null removal [25%]

Issues:
* Takes does not comply fully to EO standards anymore
* Project needs funding.

Risks
* Cactoos may not provide all features to fully replace Guava [1/7]
* Some project members may not agree in working for free until funds are added
 to project. This can cause our team to shrink and make delivery pace to slow again [4/7]
